However, upon entering the workforce in the help desk support area, I initially thought that programming was not my vocation. It was only later, on my own, that I rediscovered my love for programming, driven by the need to automate daily tasks and create applications that would optimize my team's operations.",

I started with task automations, ranging from integrating Google tools, such as Gmail + Google Sheets, to using Arduino to automate manual processes. Over time, I evolved to lead the development of full-fledged applications, solidifying my passion for turning challenges into innovative technological solutions."
